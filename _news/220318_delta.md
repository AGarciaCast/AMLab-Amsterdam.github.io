We are delighted to announce that we have renewed our collaboration with Bosch through the [Delta Lab](https://ivi.fnwi.uva.nl/uvaboschdeltalab/)! Over the next 4 years, this lab will fund 10 students and postdocs, who will be advised by [Eric Nalisnick](https://enalisnick.github.io/), [Jan-Willem van de Meent](https://jwvdm.github.io/), [Max Welling](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/m.welling/), and [Theo Gevers](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/th.gevers/).
