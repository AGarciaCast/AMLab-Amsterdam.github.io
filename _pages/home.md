The Amsterdam Machine Learning Lab (AMLab) conducts research in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and its applications to large scale data domains in science and industry. This includes the development of deep generative models, methods for approximate inference, probabilistic programming, Bayesian deep learning, causal inference, reinforcement learning, graph neural networks, and geometric deep learning. 

AMLab comprises 7 faculty. [Max Welling](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/m.welling/) and [Jan-Willem van de Meent](https://jwvdm.github.io/) serve as co-directors. [Herke van Hoof](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/h.c.vanhoof/homepage/), [Patrick Forr√©](), [Eric Nalisnick](https://enalisnick.github.io), [Erik Bekkers](https://erikbekkers.bitbucket.io/), and [Christian Naesseth](https://naesseth.github.io/) serve as tenure-track faculty. The lab participates in partnerships with industry through the [QUvA Lab](https://ivi.fnwi.uva.nl/quva/) (with Qualcomm) and the [Delta Lab](https://ivi.fnwi.uva.nl/uvaboschdeltalab/) (joint with Bosch). The lab also engages in cross-disciplinary collaborations through the [AI4Science Lab](https://ai4science-amsterdam.github.io/).
