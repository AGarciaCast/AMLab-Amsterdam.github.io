In our paper [Putting An End to End-to-End: Gradient-Isolated Learning of Representations (S. Löwe, P. O'Connor, B. S. Veeling)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11786), we showed that we can train a neural network without end-to-end backpropagation and achieve competitive performance. For this, we received an Honorable Mention for Outstanding New Directions Paper Award at NeurIPS 2019.
