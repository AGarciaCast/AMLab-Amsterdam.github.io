    I am a PhD student in Machine Learning at [Amsterdam Machine Learning Lab](/) (AMLab) and [Delta Lab](https://ivi.fnwi.uva.nl/uvaboschdeltalab/), supervised by [Eric Nalisnick](https://enalisnick.github.io), [Kaspar Sakmann](https://ksakmann.github.io), and [Christoph-Nikolas Straehle](https://www.bosch-ai.com/research/researcher-pages/t_overviewpage_51.html). I am interested in principled and efficient uncertainty quantification methods and their relations to both Bayesian and frequentist concepts, with a particular focus on applications to computer vision tasks.
