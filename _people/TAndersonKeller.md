    My first name is Thomas, but most people call me by my middle name – Andy. I’m currently a third-year PhD student supervised by Max Welling at the University of Amsterdam. My work is focused on unsupervised structured representation learning, inspired and supported by observations from neuroscience. In pursuit of this goal, during my PhD I have developed novel methods for probabilistic generative modeling which make use of biologically plausible mechanisms such as learned feedback connections and topographic organization to approximate otherwise analytically intractible solutions. In the long term, I hope to be able to answer the question of how transformations and invariances are learned and encoded in the brain, and further understand how the 2-dimensional structure of the cortical surface shapes how learning proceeds. More immediately, my current interests broadly include: developing unsupervised methods for learning approximately equivariant & invariant representations, exploring the computational benefits of topographically organized representations, and improving techniques for efficiently training deep latent variable models.
