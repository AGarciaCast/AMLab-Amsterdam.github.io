    I am a PhD student at the [Amsterdam Machine Learning Lab](https://amlab.science.uva.nl/) (AMLab) supervised by [Jan-Willem van de Meent](https://jwvdm.github.io/). Before September 2021, I was a PhD student at the [Khoury College of Computer Science](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/).

    I am interested in deep generative models and how we can guide them towards learning representations that are useful for downstream tasks.
