description: >
    I am an Associate Professor (Universitair Hoofddocent) at University of Amsterdam, where I co-direct the [AMLab](https://amlab.science.uva.nl/) with Max Welling. I am also an Assistant Professor at Northeastern University, where I am currently on leave. My group combines probabilistic programming with deep learning to develop probabilistic models for machine learning, data science, and artificial intelligence. I am one of the creators of [Anglican](https://probprog.github.io/anglican/index.html), a probabilistic programming system that is closely integrated with Clojure. My group is currently developing [Probabilistic Torch](https://github.com/probtorch/probtorch), a library for deep generative models that extends PyTorch.
