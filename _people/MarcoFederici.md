    I am a PhD student at the [Amsterdam Machine Learning Lab](https://amlab.science.uva.nl/) (AMLab) supervised by [Patrick Forré].


    My research focuses on how to use information theoretical approaches to improve model robustness when only little labled data is available and in the context of distribution shifts.
