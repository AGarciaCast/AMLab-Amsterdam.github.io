    I am a PhD student in Machine Learning at [Amsterdam Machine Learning Lab](/) (AMLab) and [Delta Lab](https://ivi.fnwi.uva.nl/uvaboschdeltalab/), supervised by [Eric Nalisnick](https://enalisnick.github.io) and [Volker Fischer](https://www.bosch-ai.com/research/researcher-pages/t_overviewpage_98.html). My research interests are in AI safety and aim to build systems that are maximally useful to the society with provable guarantees. Specifically, I am excited about human-AI compatibility and complementarity, uncertainty quantification and decision making especially in case of imprecise, vague, or conflicting information.
