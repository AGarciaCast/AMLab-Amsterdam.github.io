    I am a PhD candidate at the [Amsterdam Machine Learning Lab](https://amlab.science.uva.nl/) (AMLab) supervised by [Jan-Willem van de Meent](http://amlab.science.uva.nl/people/JanWillemVanDeMeent/), [Max Welling](http://amlab.science.uva.nl/people/MaxWelling/) and [Alfons Hoekstra](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/a.g.hoekstra/). I use deep learning in various forms to learn PDEs from data. Before joining the University of Amsterdam, I was a research assistant at Helmholtz AI, where I worked on applications of machine learning for material science. I also spent some time working on graph neural networks and generative modelling with applications in neuroscience. Long ago, I developed statistical models of clinical treatment at TU Dresden.

    Overall, my research interests revolve around physics-inspired deep learning and geometric deep learning. I am also interested in AI4Science and the applications of machine learning to physics.
