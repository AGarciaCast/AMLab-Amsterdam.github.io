    I am a PhD student at the [Amsterdam Machine Learning Lab](https://amlab.science.uva.nl/) (AMLab) and the [AI4Science Lab](https://ai4science-amsterdam.github.io/). I work together with the animal movement ecology group at the [Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics](https://ibed.uva.nl/) (IBED) on how to use machine learning to better understand and predict bird migration based on weather radar data.
