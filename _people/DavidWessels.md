    I am a PhD student at the [Amsterdam Machine Learning Lab](/) (AMLab) under the supervision of [Erik Bekkers](https://ebekkers.github.io/) and co-supervised by [Efstratios Gavves](https://www.egavves.com/) both located at the University of Amsterdam. My research focuses on the intersection of machine learning and geometry, with a particular emphasis on developing data representations grounded in their inherent geometric structures. I am especially interested in applications with tangible real-world impact, such as medical imaging and molecular generation.
