    I am a PhD student at the [Amsterdam Machine Learning Lab](/) (AMLab) with [Max Welling](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/m.welling/) and a Research Associate at Qualcomm AI Research with [Taco Cohen](https://tacocohen.wordpress.com/) and [Arash Behboodi](https://arashbehboodi.github.io/). In my research, I study how the geometry of a problem can be encoded into machine learning models to achieve improved data efficiency and generalization, with a particular focus on the task of 3D reconstruction from 2D observations.
