    I am an Assistant Professor (Universitair docent) at the University of Amsterdam and a member of [AMLab](https://amlab.science.uva.nl/). Previously, I was a postdoctoral research scientist with David Blei at the Data Science Institute, Columbia University. I completed my PhD in Electrical Engineering at Linköping University, advised by Fredrik Lindsten and Thomas Schön.

    My research interests include approximate statistical inference, causality and artificial intelligence as well as their application to the life sciences.
