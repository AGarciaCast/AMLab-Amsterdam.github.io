    I am a Ph.D. student at [Amsterdam Machine Learning Lab](http://amlab.science.uva.nl) (AMLab) and [AI4Science Lab](https://ai4science-amsterdam.github.io). I collaborate my PhD project with [Janssen](https://www.janssen.com/netherlands/nl). 
    My research focuses on using deep-learning-based models (e.g. graph neural networks) to design stable mutated proteins for vaccine research & design.
