    I am a PhD student at the [Amsterdam Machine Learning Lab](/) (AMLab) with [Max Welling](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/m.welling/) and a research associate at Qualcomm AI Research with [Taco Cohen](https://tacocohen.wordpress.com/). My research interest are about building bridges between geometric deep learning and causality. I'm trying to extend the notions of symmetry used in deep learning to include local symmetries and interventions in causal inference.
    
    Previously, I obtained a masters in theoretical physics from the University of Cambridge and a masters in AI from the University of Amsterdam.
