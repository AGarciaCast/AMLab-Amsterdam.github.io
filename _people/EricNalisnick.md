description: |
    I am an assistant professor (universitair docent) at the University of Amsterdam. My research interests span statistical machine learning and probabilistic modeling, with an emphasis on human-in-the-loop learning, specifying prior knowledge, detecting distribution shift, and quantifying uncertainty in deep learning. I previously was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Cambridge and a PhD student at the University of California, Irvine. I have also held research positions at DeepMind, Microsoft, Twitter, and Amazon. I am an ELLIS scholar, and my research is supported by an NWO Veni fellowship.
