one_liner: Autonomous systems using probabilistic and statistical modeling
description: >
    I am interested in building autonomous systems using probabilistic and statistical modeling. These systems should not simply demonstrate artificial intelligence but artificial humility as well. They need to be transparent about their beliefs and willing to admit when they might be wrong. Consider a medical system whose purpose is to diagnose a disease. A doctor can never use a system whose output is restricted to yes or no. How confident is this system? How robust are these predictions? Has the system has been validated for this patient type? How can we integrate human expertise? My research consists of formulating general algorithms that use probabilistic reasoning to answer these questions.
