one_liner: Reinforcement learning in structured domains
description: |
    I am assistant professor at the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands. My group works on various aspects of reinforcement learning in structured domains. Reinforcement learning is a very general framework, but the price of that generality is generally low data-efficiency. To address that, we investigate topics like using (symbolic) prior knowledge, encoding inductive biases in the policy structure, and transferring knowledge between tasks. We are furthermore interested in applying reinforcement learning to domains with structured states or actions, such as learning heuristics for combinatorial problem solving.
