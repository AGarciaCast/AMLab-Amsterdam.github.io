    PhD student at the [Amsterdam Machine Learning Lab](http://amlab.science.uva.nl/) (AMLab) in collaboration with the [Computational Chemistry Group](https://www.compchem.nl/), supervised by [Jan-Willem van de Meent](https://jwvdm.github.io/), [Max Welling](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/m.welling/) and [Bernd Ensing](https://www.compchem.nl/staff_members/dr-ir-b-bernd-ensing/). I’m passionate about the application of machine learning to molecular sciences. During this PhD project I’m exploring the potential of deep learning to aid in the design of catalyst materials, with the design of optimal catalysts for CO2 reduction as the ultimate goal.
