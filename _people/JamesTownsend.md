  I completed my PhD, on [lossless compression with latent variable
  models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10544), in 2020, supervised by [Professor
  David Barber](http://web4.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/D.Barber/) at the [UCL AI
  Centre](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ai-centre/) in London. Most of my research to
  date has been on deep generative models and lossless compression. I'm also
  interested in unsupervised learning more generally, approximate inference,
  Monte Carlo methods, optimization and the design of machine learning software
  systems.


  During the PhD I spent a lot of time working on the Python/NumPy automatic
  differentiation software [Autograd](https://github.com/hips/autograd). I
  interned under the tutelage of [Matthew
  Johnson](https://people.csail.mit.edu/mattjj/) at Google Brain in San
  Francisco in Spring 2018, where I was fortunate enough to work on
  [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax) during the early stages of the project.
